## Unsolved Problems
* Being able to display multiple exercises per body part rather than just displaying the first exercise in the API using the .find method

## Future Enhancements
- Add better styling
- Use another javaScript project such as .map() to display more exercise data
- Include user Authentication
- Section to track workouts
